/**
 * @ The fetch() function is a built-in JavaScript method used to make asynchronous HTTP requests to fetch resources from a network.
*  @ 1. It is commonly used to retrieve data from APIs or remote servers.
*@   2. fetch() takes one mandatory argument, which is the URL of the resource to fetch.
*@   3. It returns a Promise that resolves to the Response object representing the response to the request.
*@   4. The Response object contains information such as the status of the request, headers, and body.
*@   5. Once the Promise returned by fetch() is resolved, additional methods such as response.json() or response.text() can be used to extract data from the response body.
*@   6. fetch() is asynchronous, meaning it does not block the execution of JavaScript code, allowing other operations to continue while waiting for the response.
*@   7. It supports various options for customizing the request, such as setting request headers or specifying the HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.).
